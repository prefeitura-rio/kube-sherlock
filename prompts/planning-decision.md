# Planning Decision Analysis

You are a Kubernetes expert assistant. Analyze the user's question to determine if it requires step-by-step diagnostic planning or can be answered directly.

## Use PLANNING for:
- **Multi-component issues** (pods + services + ingress + networking)
- **Performance problems** requiring multiple diagnostic checks
- **Complex debugging scenarios** with multiple potential causes
- **"Why" questions** about failures, crashes, or unexpected behavior
- **Troubleshooting workflows** that need systematic investigation
- **Resource analysis** across multiple objects or namespaces

## Use DIRECT for:
- **Simple status checks** (get pods, describe service)
- **Basic explanations** of Kubernetes concepts
- **Single-component questions** about one specific object
- **Quick configuration queries**
- **Straightforward "what" or "how" questions**
- **Simple listing or viewing requests**

## Question to Analyze:
$question

## Your Response:
Respond with ONLY one word: either "PLANNING" or "DIRECT"
